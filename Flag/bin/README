The objective of this project was to write a program that produces an Applet which displays the United States flag to scale.
	
My project fulfills the specification correctly.
It creates a flag with 13 stripes of alternating colors (red, white), creates a blue rectangle representative of the union of the flag.
On top of the union, there are 50 white stars, in the same arrangement as on the actual flag.
All parts of the flag are to scale.
The entire Applet is scaleable, allowing you to make the flag larger/smaller via the size of the Applet.
I was not able to figure out code that would allow the user to scale the flag using mouse wheel or other methods.

I have not found any errors in my code, or anything that falls short of project expectations.
However, I think that I could've included more options in the way that the flag is scaled, as stated in the above paragraph.

The code first declares several variables to represent the dimensions of the different things on the flag.
Because paint() is executed by JApplet, I first used it to get the height and width of the Applet, in order to make the flag fit the Applet.
Then I called paintFlag(). First, a red background (made with a rectangle) is created.
In that method, I have a for loop to print 6 white stripes for the flag.
Next, I have a code that paints a blue rectangle for the union of the flag.
After that, I have code that calls the method stars() in order to print fifty stars.
The stars method takes in the x coordinate and y coordinate of the needed star and prints a star.

Some challenges I faced during making this code was that I couldn't figure out the right equations to make the flag scale properly.
I also ran into some trouble with creating the stars - the centers of the stars didn't show correctly.

Amelia helped me figure out my errors with scaling the flag, while Caleb offered a solution for the problem with the star missing its center.
