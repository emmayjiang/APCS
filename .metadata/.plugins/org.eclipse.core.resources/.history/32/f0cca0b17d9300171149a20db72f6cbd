The objective of this project was to write a program that produces an Applet which displays the United States flag to scale.
	
My project fulfills the specification correctly.
It creates a flag with 13 stripes of alternating colors (red, white), creates a blue rectangle representative of the union of the flag.
On top of the union, there are 50 white stars, in the same arrangement as on the actual flag.
All parts of the flag are to scale.
The entire applet is scaleable, allowing you to make the flag larger/smaller via the size of the applet.
I was not able to figure out code that would allow the user to scale the flag using mouse wheel or other methods.
