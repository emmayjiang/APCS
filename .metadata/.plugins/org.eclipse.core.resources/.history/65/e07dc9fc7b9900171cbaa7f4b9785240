The goal of the logical sentence puzzle assignment was to, based on a chunk of code provided by Mr. Kuszmaul, create a program that executes it as intended.

My project fulfills the specifications as it was written. There are new classes and methods inside those classes that allows the code to be executable.

Currently, one of the issues that I was unable to fix was making my truthTable() method handle not just propositional constants, but logical sentences as well.

Discussion of major challenges encountered in the process of making the code
