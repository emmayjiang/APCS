1. Is the following code legal?
try {
} finally {
}

Yes, the code is legal - a try statement doesn't have to have a catch block as long as it has a finally block.

2. What exception types can be caught by the following handler?
catch (Exception e) {    
}
What is wrong with using this type of exception handler?

This will catch any Exception, which means you may lose information about the exceptions being thrown.

3.Is there anything wrong with the following exception handler as written? Will this code compile?

try {
} catch (Exception e) {
} catch (ArithmeticException a) {   
}

The first handler catches all Exceptions, including ArithmeticException, so it will never be reached, and therefore the code won't compile.

4. Match each situation in the first list with an item in the second list.
a. int[] A;
A[0] = 0;
b. The JVM starts running your program, but the JVM can't find the Java platform classes. (The Java platform classes reside in classes.zip or rt.jar.)
c. A program is reading a stream and reaches the end of stream marker.
d. Before closing the stream and after reaching the end of stream marker, a program tries to read the stream again.
1. b: error
2. d: checked exception
3. a: compile error
4. c: no exception
